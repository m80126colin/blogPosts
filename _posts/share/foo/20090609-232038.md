內附歌詞 (香蕉王那首)

<!-- more -->

Charlie you look quite down
With your big sad eyes
And your big fat frown
The world doesn't have to be so gray

Charlie when your life's a mess
When your feeling blue
Or are in distress
I know what can wipe that sad away

All you have to do is
Put a banana in your ear (a banana in my ear?)
Put a ripe banana right into your favorite ear
It's true (says who?)
So true

Once it's in your gloom will disappear
The bad in the world is hard to hear
When in your ear a banana cheers
So go and put a banana in your ear

Put a banana in your ear (I'd rather keep my ear clear)
You will never be happy
If you live your life in fear
It's true! (says you)
So true!

When it's in the skies are bright and clear
Oh, every day of every year
The sun shines bright in this big blue sphere
So go and put a banana in your
Earrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
